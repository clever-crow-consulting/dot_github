Issues
------

Please make sure that every issue you open has the following labels:

 - [ ] Backlog label (use backlog-unknown as a default)
 - [ ] type label (Bug, User-Story, or Epic). Use type-epic as a default, because this will trigger review within the team.
 - [ ] Priority - Assign a priority of Critical/High/Medium/Low. Use priority-medium as a default. If something needs attention NOW, please notify the team outside of GitHub.
 - [ ] Area (optional) - If you know the area of the application the issue belongs to, assign it.
 - [ ] Wantedby (optional) - If a customer or internal area wants the issue, please use the wantedby labels.
